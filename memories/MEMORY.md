When diagnosing Hermes issues through the API server, execute_code is blocked by approvals.mode: manual. The approval prompt goes to the user via API but their response doesn't unblock the pending call. Use file-only tools (read_file, search_files, web_extract) for diagnosis, then give the user exact terminal commands to run, or suggest they temporarily run `hermes config set approvals.mode off` to let diagnostics run. Never retry execute_code more than 2 times.
§
User keeps Hermes profiles at /opt/data/profiles/<name>/config.yaml (not ~/.hermes/). Each needs: model, provider, system_prompt, description. Missing provider breaks execution. Rename: write new dir with write_file, rm -rf old.
§
When execute_code or skill tools hit approval/permission walls, give the user the exact terminal command to run rather than retrying the tool multiple times. User prefers self-service when automation hits limits.
§
Subagent delegation pattern: subagents (via delegate_task) CAN write files but CANNOT run terminal commands or execute_code. For any task requiring shell execution (git push, npm build, deploy scripts), the subagent writes a self-contained script via write_file, then the parent agent runs it (bash script.sh). This is a fundamental tool constraint, not an environment issue. Pass the 'terminal' + 'file' toolsets to subagents so they can write scripts.

Cron Telegram delivery: use deliver='telegram:CHAT_ID' (chat ID from gateway logs). Schedule UTC: Taiwan UTC+8 Sat 8am = '0 0 * * 6'. Test with repeat=1 + '1m' before recurring. Always remove test jobs. Cron prompts must be fully self-contained.
